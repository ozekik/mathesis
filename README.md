[Mathesis](//github.com/ozekik/mathesis) is a human-friendly Python library for computational formal logic (including mathematical, symbolic, philosophical logic), formal semantics, and theorem proving.
It is particularly well-suited for:

- Students learning logic and educators teaching it
- Researchers in fields like logic, philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and many others

**Documentation:** <https://mathesis.readthedocs.io/>

## Key features

- Interactive theorem proving for humans (proof assistant)
- Automated theorem proving (automated reasoning)
- Define models and check validity of inferences in the models
- JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook support
- Output formulas/proofs in LaTeX
- Customizable ASCII/Unicode syntax (like `A -> B`, `A → B`, `A ⊃ B`)

## Installation

```bash
pip install mathesis
```
